DCCLite
-------

- Lua script failing to reload, seems to be a problem with sections
- Why lua scripts are not notified when devices gets online and state changes during sync? Check routes
- Implement coroutine support on lua scripts?

- add const for all timeouts on a single file
- add port list for all connections on a single file
- update route section to know next section and avoid re-ocupying the block

- remove deprecate SHA1 usage on Linux

- Thinker: use RName instead of stringview

LitePanelSDL
------------

- Handle mouse click and create object on map
- Add scrollbars
- Load / Save

- Replace tile map on toolbar with imgui buttons
- include scroll bars on tile map view
- Create a generic editor, that can be used by SDL and wxWidgets?
	- supports the tiles edits (receive mouse clicks with toolbar info)
	- handles scrolling and rendering
	- toolbar buttons can be generic too

- add imgui open file windows (remove windows dependencies)
- Main application, split between Editor and Runner


- When loading:
	- document infra structure?
	- Settings from last run infrastructure?

	- if no file provided or no previous working project:
		- prompt with new project dialog

	- if previous project on working mode, load editor
	- if previous project on runner mode, load runner


- Requirements:
	- every save, put a copy of previous file on temp with a timestamp
	- allow recovery of previous version from the temp (if exists)

		- config per locomotive
		- handle throttle settings and simulates cosumption
		- refueliing system
- JMRI JSON server
	- can be use to monitor wiThrottle commands
