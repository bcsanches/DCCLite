DCCLite
-------
- test new dccex commands, check if turnout description helps anyway
- update route section to know next section and avoid re-ocupying the block

- Auto generate MAC address

  void DCCTimer::getSimulatedMacAddress(byte mac[6]) {
    for (byte i=0; i<6; i++) {
      // take the fist 3 and last 3 of the serial.
      // the first 5 of 8 are at 0x0E to 0x013
      // the last  3 of 8 are at 0x15 to 0x017
      mac[i]=boot_signature_byte_get(0x0E + i + (i>2? 4 : 0));
    }
    mac[0] &= 0xFE;
    mac[0] |= 0x02;
  }

- Auto config device name
	- SharpTerminal will show unconfigured devices and allow to configure its name

LitePanelSDL
------------

- Move new item on tilemap when mouse moves
- Draw tile items correctly when tile map scrolls
- Handle mouse click and create object on map
- Add scrollbars
- Load / Save

- Replace tile map on toolbar with imgui buttons
- include scroll bars on tile map view
- Create a generic editor, that can be used by SDL and wxWidgets?
	- supports the tiles edits (receive mouse clicks with toolbar info)
	- handles scrolling and rendering
	- toolbar buttons can be generic too

- add imgui open file windows (remove windows dependencies)
- Main application, split between Editor and Runner


- When loading:
	- document infra structure?
	- Settings from last run infrastructure?

	- if no file provided or no previous working project:
		- prompt with new project dialog

	- if previous project on working mode, load editor
	- if previous project on runner mode, load runner


- Requirements:
	- every save, put a copy of previous file on temp with a timestamp
	- allow recovery of previous version from the temp (if exists)


LitePanelWx
-----------

- fix rendering errors

- EngineDriver layer
	- connects directly to DCCex
	- avoids JMRI for running trains
	- reads DEcoderPro custom names for commands and provides it to EngineDriver
	- supports DccLite own routes
	- emulate fuel consumption:
		- config per locomotive
		- handle throttle settings and simulates cosumption
		- refueliing system
