DCCLite
-------

- Flashing output, how to avoid all messages?
	- put a flash flag on output
		- Create a FlashOutput, when on, will turn on the flash flag on output
		- output will flash (or not) according to the flag
			- OutputDecoder - the existing output
			- FlashOutputDecoder - new decoder with flashing capability
			- FlashOutputDecoderController - turns on / off the flag on above
	- Update signals to use it

	- Create a FlashOutput, use same pin and does the flashing logic
		- dcclite will complain due to pin conflict

	- FlashOutput will turn on / off the output
		- more logical, but again, dcclite will go crazy trying to turn it off and not syncing state, will mess up the net protocol

- SharpConsole runs Broker locally directly?
	- Starts it
	- monitors log
	- capability to filter log output

- Store time device connected and disconnected
	- Send this to sharp terminal
	- session history?
		- with connects and disconnected
		- number of packets?
		- Button on sharp terminal to open session history

- Better emulator:	
	- Remote connect to emulators
	- Allow pin states to be set:
		- Set voltage level: LOW or HIGH
		- Do a Pin "click", so voltage invert for a short time (put a time config, like 10ms)	
	- put a emulator hints field on device config? So initial voltage for pins can be set, like a grounded pin or a pin connected to 5v
		- pin on emulator must have a "externalVoltage" field, a tri state field and when reading, check if the externalVoltage is set, if yes, consider it, otherwise, the internal voltage
		- digitalWrite will never affetct externalVoltage
		- SharpTerminal will be able to set this externalVoltage value

- SharpTerminal
	- Dashboard
		- Display unregistered arduinos
		- Detect arduino on USB and offer to burn it

- Create SignalInterlock
	- where it will be stored? SignalLogicManager on BrokerShellLib? Dispatcher?
		Dispatcher
			- interlocks
			- controllers
			- sections
	- new entity, used to control signals.
	- It will refer to a Signal and set its aspects
	- states:
		- danger: signal starts on danger state, runs danger logic, if still in danger, waits for any condition to change
			- if not in danger, stays idle
	- Contains
		- danger / stop logic: list of turnouts, sensors, returns true with in danger.
		- aspects, for example:
			- Clear: contains list of turnouts, sensors, returns true if aspect can be set
			- Slow:  contains list of turnouts, sensors, returns true if aspect can be set

		- When an aspect is set, the signal locks its turnouts and monitor sensors / rouse_sections
			- hint route_section of the expected direction

- SignalController
	- Managers a SignalInterlock
	- AutoSignalController
		- monitors the signal inputs, if route is clear, sets the signal do clear
	- ManualSignalController
		- Accepts user input and set a signal to clear if possible

- Dispatcher
	- SectionManager: manages all sections? 
	- Section: the base with two sensors?
		- when on sensor gets hit, defines the direction		
	- BlockSection: a block with an entry and exit sensor, no turnouts, simple block for stopping a train
	- TrackSection: is it necessary? Consider as main line?
	- Abandon TrackSection on dispatcher
	- TripleTrackSection: the same as track section, but with two sections and only one active at time
	- update route section to know next section and avoid re-ocupying the block
	- it may have a direction set (will be used by signal logic)

- Implement coroutine support on lua scripts?

- Make a EngineDriver Server, redirect to DCCex Directly and goodbye JMRI
	- Reads locomotive data from DecoderPro
	- Allows input redirection, ie:
		- On european engines, sets F1 (sound on / off) to F8 (NMRA default)
		- call lua scripts on buttons?

LitePanelSDL
------------

- Handle mouse click and create object on map
- Add scrollbars
- Load / Save

- Replace tile map on toolbar with imgui buttons
- include scroll bars on tile map view
- Create a generic editor, that can be used by SDL and wxWidgets?
	- supports the tiles edits (receive mouse clicks with toolbar info)
	- handles scrolling and rendering
	- toolbar buttons can be generic too

- add imgui open file windows (remove windows dependencies)
- Main application, split between Editor and Runner


- When loading:
	- document infra structure?
	- Settings from last run infrastructure?

	- if no file provided or no previous working project:
		- prompt with new project dialog

	- if previous project on working mode, load editor
	- if previous project on runner mode, load runner


- Requirements:
	- every save, put a copy of previous file on temp with a timestamp
	- allow recovery of previous version from the temp (if exists)


LitePanelWx
-----------

- fix rendering errors
- render using DBI? abandon OpenGL?

- EngineDriver layer
	- connects directly to DCCex
	- avoids JMRI for running trains
	- reads DEcoderPro custom names for commands and provides it to EngineDriver
	- supports DccLite own routes
	- emulate fuel consumption:
		- config per locomotive
		- handle throttle settings and simulates cosumption
		- refueliing system
- JMRI JSON server
	- can be use to monitor wiThrottle commands
