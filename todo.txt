DCCLite
-------
- test new dccex commands, check if turnout description helps anyway

LitePanelSDL
------------

- Create new button class for toolbar:
class ToolButton
{
	MakeInsertCmd(TilePos &pos, TileMap &pos)
	{
		if tile ocupied
			create delete cmd

		create insert cmd

		return cmd sequence
	}

	MakePlaceHolderObject
	{
		reutrn a temp object to be use as cursor
	}
}

- Replace tile map on toolbar with imgui buttons
- include scroll bars on tile map view
- Create a generic editor, that can be used by SDL and wxWidgets?
	- supports the tiles edits (receive mouse clicks with toolbar info)
	- handles scrolling and rendering
	- toolbar buttons can be generic too

- add imgui open file windows (remove windows dependencies)
- Main application, split between Editor and Runner


- When loading:
	- document infra structure?
	- Settings from last run infrastructure?

	- if no file provided or no previous working project:
		- prompt with new project dialog

	- if previous project on working mode, load editor
	- if previous project on runner mode, load runner


- Requirements:
	- every save, put a copy of previous file on temp with a timestamp
	- allow recovery of previous version from the temp (if exists)

To Explore
----------
- EngineDriver layer
	- connects directly to DCCex
	- avoids JMRI for running trains
	- reads DEcoderPro custom names for commands and provides it to EngineDriver
	- supports DccLite own routes
	- emulate fuel consumption:
		- config per locomotive
		- handle throttle settings and simulates cosumption
		- refueliing system
