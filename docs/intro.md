Welcome to the DCCLite wiki!

DCCLite is a software collection that allow you to configure and create an Arduino network for controlling model railroad devices, called devices.

Each device (or Arduino node on the network) can be configured to have one or more [decoders], that would be responsible to controlling the physical devices on your layout, like servo motors, leds, signals, etc; or reading state from input devices like sensors and report back to the central software that coordinate all the work called [Broker].

The Broker simple acts like a central hub that coordinate all the devices work and provide communication with known software, like JMRI, that you can use a PC for controlling your model railroad or even your mobile phone.

For helping you getting started, please take a look on our [Getting Started] guide.
