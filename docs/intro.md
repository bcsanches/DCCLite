#Welcome to the DCCLite!

**DCCLite** is a software collection that allow you to configure and create an Arduino network for controlling model railroad devices, called [decoders](decoders.md).

Each device (or Arduino node on the network) can be configured to have one or more [decoders](decoders.md), that would be responsible to controlling the physical devices on your layout, like servo motors, leds, signals, etc; or reading state from input devices like sensors and report back to the central software that coordinate all the work called [Broker](broker.md).

The Broker simple acts as a central hub that coordinate all the devices work and provide communication with known software, like [JMRI](https://www.jmri.org/), that you can use a PC for controlling your model railroad or even your mobile phone.

For helping you getting started, please take a look on our [Getting Started](getting_started.md) guide.
