			New vs. Set
	The New verb is used to create a new resource. The Set verb is used to modify an existing resource, optionally creating the resource if it does not exist, such as the Set-Variable cmdlet.

	Find vs. Search
	The Find verb is used to look for an object. The Search verb is used to create a reference to a resource in a container.

	Get vs. Read
	The Get verb is used to retrieve a resource, such as a file. The Read verb is used to get information from a source, such as a file.

	Invoke vs. Start
	The Invoke verb is used to perform an operation that is generally a synchronous operation, such as running a command. The Start verb is used to begin an operation that is generally an asynchronous operation, such as starting a process.
